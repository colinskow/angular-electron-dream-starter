        Rather than wiring up two-way data-binding ourselves with [value] and (input)
        we can use Angular's [(ngModel)] syntax
        <input type="text" name="textInput" [(ngModel)]="localState.value" autofocus>

    <pre>this.localState = {{ localState | json }}</pre>
    <p>The `valueComputed` property is the value returned from the main process</p>
